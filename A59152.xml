            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>On a time as <hi>Luther</hi> was walking in his Garden, the Devil appeared to him in the likeness of a black Boor; but <hi>Luther</hi> sleighting and not regarding him, he vanished away.</p>
            <p>Another of the <hi>German</hi> Divines in <hi>Luthers</hi> time, as he was sitting at his Book in his Study, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil appeared to him, looking over his Shoulder, which the Minister perceiving, took a piece of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and wrote in it, <hi>The Son of God came to dissolve the works of the Devil;</hi> and so holding up the Paper to the Devil, he also vanished.</p>
            <p>In allusion hereunto, comparatively we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the Subject now in hand, to the publick view and consideration of the most Ingenuous and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Reader, it being a thing worthy of observation; and as it lately hapned near the <hi>Faulcon</hi> at the <hi>Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,</hi> so is the Truth still verified at this instant: For within these few dayes, Master <hi>Scot,</hi> a Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> hearing of a Spirit that walked at the house of one Master <hi>Powel,</hi> deceased (formerly a Baker, living in the Borough of <hi>Southwark</hi>) immediately went to the said House, and there making enquiry of the Truth thereof, <hi>Jone Finchley</hi> (a Servant to the said <hi>Powel</hi> during his life-time) told him, <hi>That it was too true, for her Master did walk, and that in several shapes, and at divers seasons; sometimes at Noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, sometimes towards the Evening, and sometimes at Mid-night</hi> Therefore true it is, that ever since Mr. <hi>Powel</hi> departed this Life, (which is about five Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths ago) there hath been a hideous noise heard in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:36471:3"/> the House, and a gre<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> vanished down the stairs: But the next night it appeared again in the likeness of a Goat, as the Maid was again making her Bed; which she perceiving, ve<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y confidently said, <hi>In the Name of God, avoid Satan;</hi> at which words she cast another Bed-staff: The Spirit then vanished, in like manner as before; but here it did not rest, for the next morning as <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Maid was making of a fire, the Doors being all shut, she heard a great noise, and a creeking of the Yard-door; which caused her to demand, <hi>Who was there?</hi> To whom the Spirit an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, <hi>'Tis thy Master</hi> Jone, <hi>it is thy Master; where is my Son</hi> Thomas <hi>My Master,</hi> (replies the Maid) <hi>that cannot be, I am sure my Master was buried long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough ago, to leave speaking now;</hi> And thereupon rose up from the fire, and with her former confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence went to look what Voice it was, but she could not discern any thing at present, whereupon she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took her self to her labour about the House, and towards the Evening, going into the Garden, under a Pear-Tree, she espied her old Master standing up, with his Fists knit close togethe,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36471:4"/> his Eyes half sunk in his Head, his Face extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Black, and in the same Cloaths he used to wear when he was alive.</p>
            <p>This sudden Apparition, did very much amaze and startle her, putting her into a great trembling, quivering, and shaking; since which time, she hath been very ill, and on <hi>Monday</hi> last lay dangerous sick in the Borough, having left the Dwelling-house of her old Master, scituated near the <hi>Faulcon</hi> at the <hi>Banck-side:</hi> But the troubled Spirit remains there still, and the House is as much haunted as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; notwithstanding some Artists (by some called Conjurers) remain there day and night, using all possible means they can to lay this troubled Spirit, and are continually reading and making of Circles, burning of Wax Candles, and <hi>Juniper</hi>-wood; but as yet all proves unfeasible; onely thus far they ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected their work, That some few nights ago, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made a great Circle in the Garden, the Spirit of Master <hi>Powel</hi> appeared, to whom one of them said: <hi>We conjure thee to depart to by place of Rest.</hi> He answered, <hi>Wo be to those that we<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The rest (being eight in number) kept close to their Books, and fain would have broug<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> him into the Circle, but could not; whereupon one of them said, <hi>The Son of God appeared to destroy the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orks of the Devil:</hi> which caused him to vanish away in a flash of Fire, hitting one of them upon the Leg, who hath lain lame ever since, and left such a scent
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:36471:4"/> of Brimstone in the Garden, that all the <hi>Juniper</hi>-wood they could burn for many hours together, could not take away that sulphurous smell. Many there hath been to enquire of the Tru<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h hereof, who are very well satisfied therein, and some of the Gentlemen (before specified) still remain in the House, to allay the Spirit, if they can; for it is conjectured, there hath been much Money hid, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Garden or about the House, which as yet cannot be discovered.</p>
            <p>Since the appearing of Mr. <hi>Powel</hi> in several <hi>Shapes,</hi> his Son <hi>Thomas</hi> being left Executour, and <hi>Moneys</hi> being supposed to be hid, the Garden was digged in several p<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aces, and at last they dis overed two Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins of <hi>Money;</hi> but the more they dug, the lower it sunk, so that their work, at present, proves labour in vain; yet all possible means is still used, both to allay the Spirit, and to gain the hidden Treasure.</p>
            <p>But as yet he appears at Noon-day, walking in his Garden, and divers eminent Persons (both for Religion, and Piety) have waited several Seasons, and Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for his appearance, hoping thereby to gain some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with the troubled Spirit, and by that means to allay it, and to send it to everlasting Rest. Amongst the rest, Mr. <hi>John Simpson,</hi> formerly Minister of Bishops-Gate, had some discourse with this Spirit, as he stood under a Tree: And asking him, <hi>In the Name of God the Fa her, Son, and Holy Ghost, the cause of his appearing, and departing from Rest?</hi> A Voice answered, <hi>For things unseen;</hi> And that the cause of his Rising was, about a Grand-Daughter of his, whom he desired might have satisfaction from the Dead, it having been some way unjustly dealt by before his Departure.</p>
            <p>And then immediately, after some Sighings, and Groans, it seemed to vanish.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:36471:5"/>
            <p>Thus having given you a true Relation of this sad Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition; in the next place, be pleased to take notice, of another strange Vision appearing in Long-Alley near Moor-fields, in the shape and likeness of Mr. <hi>Davis,</hi> former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a sum of Money, conjured down for 7 years; but the time being expired, he again walks; and appearing to his daughter <hi>Susan,</hi> at Noon-day, took her by the hand, at which she was exceedingly affrighted; and asking her how she did, at last she replyed, <hi>Well, I praise God. I wish the like to you. Father, what is your business, would you speak with my Mother?</hi> No, no, said he, speaking with a most hideous voice, and in the Night he utters such terrible groans, that the Neighbours are forced to remove to a further distance. He sometimes appears with a Plaister on his face, as if murthered; and on Wednesday night last, many sad groans, and heavy cryes, were heard from this restless Ghost by 4 Doctours, who sat up to see if they could by any means discover the cause of his walking; but to them he was invisible; and the work is difficult to allay him, if blood hath been shed violently; for true it is, that Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will certainly cry aloud for Vegeance, till satisfied by Justice.</p>
